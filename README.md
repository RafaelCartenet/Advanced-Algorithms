# AdvancedAlgorithms
Advanced algorithms developped within INSA course :

## Dynamic Programing
- LongestSubSequenceXY (Extract the longest sub-sequence of two sequences)
- MinimumMultiplications (Compute the minimum number of multiplications to compte the multiplication of N given matrix)
- cubepyramide (Given n elementary cubes, what's the minimum number of cubes and pyramides that we can do)
- Knapsack (Famous algorithm, returns the best combination of given objects according to their weight and their value in order to not exceed a given total weight)

## Graph theory
- Prim (Prim algorithm. Goal : determine the Minimum spanning tree of a given graph)

## Other
- isPrime (returns a boolean whether the input is prime or not, based on an interesting property of prime numbers)
